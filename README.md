Fun tidbits from my time on the internet:
- my [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2689253) page. likely auto-generated, though i've been editing it haha.
- most seen project was a [website that i made in 2 hours in 8th grade](https://github.com/jaideng1/beep-beep) that was on [YIAY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54o_roaxjkg&t=416s). jacksfilms also [tweeted the website out](https://x.com/jacksfilms/status/1396221625356279811), really testing the capabilities of github pages that day.
