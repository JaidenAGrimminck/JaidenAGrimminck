### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jaiden (he/him). 

I'm a Dutch-Aussie-American high school student currently studying in the Netherlands. I love travelling, backpacking, reading, sailing, playing trumpet, and coding. I have experience in JS, HTML/CSS, Python, Java, C#, C++, GLSL, and whatever else I may need for a project. I've worked with frameworks and tools such as ReactJS, Express/socket.io, Unity, Arduino, and more.

Fun tidbits from my time on the internet:
- my [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2689253) page. this is legit, I literally did not make this page. I've been editing it though haha.
- largest project was a [website that i made in 2 hours in 8th grade](https://github.com/jaideng1/beep-beep) that was featured on [YIAY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54o_roaxjkg&t=416s). he (jacksfilms) also [tweeted the website out](https://x.com/jacksfilms/status/1396221625356279811). based on views and the tweet, the website likely got approximately 1 million impressions haha - i did not put any analytics on the website though. the [accompanying video that I made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHFePAMAG_c) got ~14k views as well
